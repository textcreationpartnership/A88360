            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN Alarum to Warre.</head>
            <p>THough the countenance of Warre be horrid and formidable to all Nations, in regard of the inevitable ruine, and certaine deſtruction which it carries along with it (for <hi>nulla ſalus bello,</hi> there's no ſafety, but all vaſtation and deſolation in the time of Warre) yet when the matchleſſe tyranny of Popiſh Rebells ſhall exalt it ſelfe over the liberties, conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and lives of our deare brethren in <hi>Ireland,</hi> who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe the Proteſtant Religion, when their horrible out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages have been there committed, are ſtill perpetrated and continued, to the ſtupifying even of Amazement it ſelfe, to the hazard of that Kingdome, and perill of this; in ſuch a caſe, the aſpect of Warre is both ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and acceptable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>De nobis narratur,</hi> The caſe is our owne. Thoſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>farious miſcreants, have not only unlawfully ſurprized many Townes and Cities in that Iſland, but their cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed rage hath been ſo implacably bent againſt the poore Proteſtants (their ſelves being violently tranſported beyond all bounds of nature and humanity) that they have moſt unmercifully and unchriſtianly fired divers places which they have invaded, and ſavagely ſacrificed the inhabitants to their miſchievous malice, and inſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate inſolency. Never were Tartars, Turkes and Mahu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans ſo bloodily minded, as theſe villaines have been. Thoſe Monſters of nature (for men I will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ot terme them) have not onely ſacked and pillaged whereſoever they have come, but they have taken delight to torture
<pb facs="tcp:156573:3"/>the Proteſtants without any bowells of compaſſion. They have raviſhed, and deflowred chaſte women, and virgins, throwne ſmall children into R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ers with Pitchforkes; they ſtripped 1500 ſtark-naked, driving them (like Dogges) towards <hi>Dublin,</hi> drowned and killed many of them by the way, cutting off Pious, Proteſtant Miniſters and their wives in pieces. I tremble to ſpeake it, they have ſearcht Womens privities for money, and in a moſt horrid and ſtupendious manner, they have ript up their wombes great with childe, and ſlaine with the ſword, both them and their infants.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Quis talia fando,</l>
               <l>Temperet a lachrymis?</l>
            </q>
            <p>The Cruell enemie (whoſe very mercies have been cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties) hath powred out their blood in every ſtreet, and there hath been no friend to helpe them: but in much mercy of late, it hath pleas'd the Almighty to conſider their diſtreſſe. Hee will not ſuffer the rod of the wicked alwayes to lie upon the back of the righteous. Vengeance (though ſlow) is ſure: And God will be ávenged for the blood of his Saints, their blood being in <hi>conſpectu Domini,</hi> in the ſight of the Lord, as precious as their death.</p>
            <p>Sinne has a crying voice, and the effuſion of innocent blood is of all other ſinnes
<hi>peccatum clamans:</hi> It cryes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowd from the bortome of the earth, to the top of heaven. As the ſinnes of <hi>Sodome</hi> were great, and the cry of them came up before the Almighty; So the Sanguinean ſinne of curſed <hi>Caine</hi> cryed unto heaven, to the God of Heaven for vengeanc. In like manner, the blood of thoſe poore Proteſtants, ſo undeſervedly and lamentably ſpilt, hath made ſuch a clamour in the All-hearing eares of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie, that hee hath been graciouſly pleaſed in pitty and compaſſion of their manifold miſeries, and moſt grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous maſſacres, by a coeleſtiall voice, to ſpeake to the
<pb facs="tcp:156573:3"/>heart of his deare Anointed, our dread Soveraigne, <hi>and to</hi> his heavenly-minded Parliament, to commiſerate their deplorable calamities, and forthwith releive them with a powerfull (heaven-proſpering) Army.</p>
            <p>Hereupon the voice of Warre is proclaimed, a ſtatute for it by the King, and the high and Honourable Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of Parliament, hath been enacted, the Commiſſion to his Maieſties Officers to preſſe both land and Sea-men, hath iſſued forth.</p>
            <p>The Lord of Hoſts goe along with our hoſts, guide and direct them in all their wayes, proſper their cauſe, grant them a propitious ſucceſſe, and glorious victory over his and their blood-thirſty enemies: And I pray God ſend more auxiliary Forces to them who are already there ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived, that in ſo iuſt a quarrell they may be the better co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolated, and animated, that the Rebells may with more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility be quelled and conquered, and that the Kingdome of <hi>Ireland</hi> may be the ſooner reduced to their due ſubie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and awfull obedience to the Crowne of <hi>England,</hi> and to the lawe and ordinances made by his Maieſtie, and his States of both Kindomes.</p>
            <p>There was never any King that had more iuſt and weighty cauſe to warre againſt a people at any time, then his Maieſtie hath againſt the Rebells at this time. And as the cauſe is urgent, ſo the expedition of it is as important. There was never a more requiſite neceſſitie of a ſpeedy ſupply, then at this preſent; For the Rebellion there is ſo generall, that it is not the force of a ſmall Army from hence that can ſuppres them. Though there are no ſpiders in the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland</hi> (as many have averred &amp; main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained) yet the Romiſh Spider hath ſpun ſo fowl a web in that faire Iſland, that it hath need of a great beeſome to ſweep it out again. And for the better confirmation here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, It is not only publikely rumor'd, but credibly reported,
<pb facs="tcp:156573:4"/>that neighboring Princes have taken up Arms, the one of
<hi>Spaine,</hi> &amp; the other of <hi>France,</hi> both of them at this preſent very potent at Sea; and it is generally ſuppoſed, that they are intended for <hi>Ireland,</hi> to aſſiſt theſe Aſſaſſinates againſt the Proteſtants.</p>
            <p>Thus the <hi>Hydra</hi> of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Faction doth dayly mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply, their Army doth encreaſe, yet God be thanked, ſome of their Men and Ammunition have been of late intercep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and prevented; and I pray God, in this particular, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue his goodneſſe ſtill unto us. Their Forces are very ſtrong, their Aſſiſtants and adherents for the preſent being potent, their inſolencies are grown to the utmoſt height of impious impudence &amp; impudent impietie: They are reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, no more to be ſubiect to the Crowne of <hi>England,</hi> and the Lawes &amp; Statutes of the Kingdome; but their unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable demand is, to have ſuch a Vice-Roy, or Gubernator, as may be well accepted of by them, and no other.</p>
            <p>Thus as they have caſt out of their hearts Chriſtian com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion to the K. ſubiects, ſo they have caſt off from their necks the yoke of due ſubiection to the King himſelfe. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels they have proclaim'd themſelves to the whole world, and that in <hi>ſummo gradu,</hi> in the higheſt degree, of as high a nature, as ever Hiſtories have recorded, or age of man can co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>memorate. Never did the wildfire of their hideous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracies ſo circumvolve it ſelfe into one violent flame, the actors thereof being ſo unanimous in their Diabolicall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes, (that Helliſh Gunpowder-Plot of Treaſon onely excepted) as this laſt yeere hath bin attempted by them.</p>
            <p>'Tis not long ſince a <hi>Roman</hi> Prieſt was ſent from the Pope, who was landed here in
<hi>England,</hi> and hath cunningly and cloſely wrought with diverſe <hi>Engliſh</hi> Catholiques a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, to prepare themſelves to put in execution ſuch determinations and reſolutions as ſhall be propounded to them, for the defence of their Religion, and ruine of our

<hi>Ireland,</hi> &amp; landed their Forces here in <hi>England.</hi> Thus you may evidently ſee, that their exorbitant offences have bin ſo haynous and, facino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and their crimes are ſtill ſo capi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <l>Gens Romana ruit per vetitum nefas.</l>
            </q>
            <p>But what mean ye, O ye beſotted ſonnes of Inſurrection? Will ye, through your Rebellion, deſperately periſh? Fooles &amp; mad men as ye are, <hi>Quae vos dementia cepit?</hi> How long will ye abuſe the divine Patience? What, or who hath deluded &amp; bewitched you? for Rebellion is as the ſinne of Witchraft. Hath Ambition, the Pope, or the Devill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigated, and ſeduced you thereunto? Or rather, have not all theſe three bin Agents (though one of them were ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent) for your confuſion? To theſe three, take three more to your conſideration; which if they doe not worke in your hearts an impreſſion of contrition, they will ſerve for an addition of horror and aſtoniſhment to your wretched ſoules. Is there not a ſevere Iudge above you, that can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne you? Is there not a gnawing Conſcience within you, that wil terrifie you? And laſtly, Is there not a tormenting <hi>Tophet</hi> below you, that gapes for your obſtinate Rebellion? Know thus much (ye unfortunate ſonnes of miſchiefe) that as ſoon as ye have made up the full meaſure of your iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as the <hi>Amorites</hi> did then the Sicle of Gods Iudgement will cut you all off. For God is righteous, the Truth of God is eternall, Hell is where it was, and your damnation without contrition, will be iuſt.</p>
